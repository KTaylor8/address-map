# Code Snippets from Expedia Software Development Apprenticeship Project

## Contents

These are non-confidental code snippets that I extracted from the project I worked on as a Software Development Apprentice at Expedia Group (summer 2019). The full code of our project uses some confidential resources and is now property of Expedia Group.

Because these snippets were originally embedded within a larger program, they are **not** fully-finished stand-alone programs (hence the removal of front-end design aspects), but I hope to be able to apply the essential functionality to future projects.

## Context

During the summer of 2019, I collaborated with another Apprentice within the Omni-Channel Communications (OCC) team to design and develop the initial stages of a system to help customers easily find events near their hotel and promote Expedia’s Things To Do. In our system, a target segment of customers that book a hotel will trigger an SMS/push notification that includes contains a deep link to a webpage with events near their hotel. The events are able to be sorted by distance, rating, or price. For each event, the customer is able to purchase tickets, map out the location of their event in relation to their hotel, and read other customers’ reviews among other options.

I focused primarily on the system’s ability to interact with numerous APIs and to use those responses to dynamically render various elements on our webpage and trigger notifications. I used JavaScript to code functionality such as handling user hotel data, generating the event cards, and visualizing the event and hotel locations on a map. I also helped to troubleshoot the HTML and CSS on the webpage displaying the events.
